The application is similar to an Amazon-like storefront with mySQL.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

The user will be prompted to enter an ID number for the associated item they wish to purchase and a transaction will be made if the item is in stock. The stock quantity will then update.

If the item is not in stock, the user will be notified that the item is not in stock or if the user purchases more of a quantity than is available, they will be prompted to try again.

The user can quit the application by typing "q"

This screenshot shows the application working. Here you can see the information from the inventory:
